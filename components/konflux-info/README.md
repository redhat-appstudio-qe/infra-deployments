# 🚀 konflux-info Repository Guide

## <a name='DirectoryStructure'></a>📂 Directory Structure

The `KONFLUX-INFO` directory contains:

```bash
.
├── base/                   # Common resources (e.g., RBAC)
├── production/             # Production cluster configurations
├── staging/                # Staging cluster configurations
├── banner-schema.json      # JSON schema definition for validating banner-content.yaml files
```

Each cluster directory contains:

```bash
.
├── banner-content.yaml # The banner content shown in the UI
├── info.json # Metadata about the cluster
└── kustomization.yaml # Kustomize configuration for this cluster

```

### <a name='BannerContentValidation'></a>✅ Banner Content Validation

To maintain consistency, a GitHub workflow named **`banner-validate`** automatically validates all `banner-content.yaml` files against the schema defined in [`banner-schema.json`](./banner-schema.json).

**When does it run?**

- On any pull request that changes:
  - `banner-schema.json` (schema definition)
  - Any `banner-content.yaml` file (banner configurations)

**What does it check?**

- Ensures the YAML structure matches the schema (e.g., required fields, allowed values, date/time format).
- Prevents invalid or misconfigured banners from being merged.

**How to fix validation errors?**

- Review the error message in the PR checks.
- Compare your changes with the [schema](./banner-schema.json) and [examples in README](#usage-scenarios--examples).

### <a name='BannerContentSpecification'></a>✅ Banner Content Specification

The `banner-content.yaml` file defines one or more banners displayed in the Konflux UI. Each cluster has its own `banner-content.yaml` under its directory (e.g., `staging/stone-stage-p01/banner-content.yaml`).

#### <a name='Schema'></a>**Schema**

The schema for banner content is defined in [`banner-schema.json`](./banner-schema.json) and validated automatically by the `banner-validate` GitHub workflow on every PR.

The file must contain a **YAML list** where each item represents a banner configuration.

#### <a name='RequiredandOptionalFieldsforEachBanner'></a>**Required and Optional Fields for Each Banner**

📎 For the full schema used in CI validation, see banner-schema.json. This table is a human-friendly reference for banner authors.

| Field        | Type   | Required | Description                                                               |

| `dayOfWeek`  | number | ❌       | Day of week (0=Sunday, 6=Saturday) for weekly recurrence.                 |
| `dayOfMonth` | number | ❌       | Day of month (1–31). Required if `year` or `month` is specified.          |

⚠️ **If any of `year`, `month`, `dayOfWeek`, or `dayOfMonth` is specified, both `startTime` and `endTime` are required.**

### <a name='HowtosubmitaPRforBanner'></a>📝 How to submit a PR for Banner

1. Locate the target cluster directory:

- For staging: `staging/<cluster-name>/banner-content.yaml`
- For production: `production/<cluster-name>/banner-content.yaml`

2. Edit banner-content.yaml:

- <strong style="color: red;">Insert the new banner at the top of the list</strong>.
- Remove obsolete banners to keep the list clean.

  Example:

  ```yaml
  # New banner on top
  - summary: "New feature rollout on July 30"
    type: "info"
    year: 2025
    month: 7
    dayOfMonth: 30
    startTime: "09:00"
    endTime: "17:00"

  # Keep other active banners below
  - summary: "Maintenance every Sunday"
    type: "info"
    dayOfWeek: 0
    startTime: "02:00"
    endTime: "04:00"
  ```

3. Submit a Pull Request:

- Modify only the target cluster’s banner-content.yaml.
  In the PR description, include:
- Target cluster (e.g., kflux-ocp-p01)
- Type of change (e.g., new banner / update / remove obsolete)
- Purpose of change (e.g., release announcement, downtime notice)

  Example:

  ```yaml
  Target cluster: kflux-ocp-p01
  Type: New banner
  Purpose: Release announcement for Konflux 1.2
  ```

### <a name='UIBehavior'></a>✅ UI Behavior

- The <strong style="color: red;">UI displays only the first valid active banner</strong> from the list, based on current date, time, and optional recurrence settings.
- If multiple banners are configured, <strong style="color: red;">order matters</strong>.
- <strong style="color: red;">Time-related fields like `startTime` and `endTime` are not displayed in the UI</strong>; they only control when the banner is active.

  <strong>To convey duration or timing details, please include them within the `summary`.</strong>

- <strong style="color: red;">The `type` and `summary` fields are displayed directly in the UI</strong>.
- We enjoyed leveraging the [PatternFly Banner component (v5)](https://v5-archive.patternfly.org/components/banner/) to implement the UI, following its design principles for clarity and consistency.

### <a name='FrequentlyAskedQuestions'></a>❓ Frequently Asked Questions

- Why is only one banner shown even when multiple are configured?

  <strong style="color: red;">We follow the [PatternFly design guidelines](https://www.patternfly.org/components/banner/design-guidelines) for banners</strong>, which emphasize simplicity and clarity. Showing just one banner line at a time helps avoid overwhelming users and ensures that important messages aren't lost in clutter.

- What does “first active” actually mean?

  <strong style="color: red;">The term 'first' doesn’t imply priority or severity</strong> — it simply refers to the first banner that is currently active based on time and repeat configuration.

  If a banner was scheduled in the past, it should already have been displayed.

  If it's scheduled in the future, it will show when its time comes.

  At any given moment, the system checks which banner is active right now, and picks the first one that matches the criteria.

  🕒 Banners use fields like `startTime`, `endTime`, `dayOfWeek`, etc., to precisely define when they should appear.

  <strong style="color: red;">📝 If multiple messages need to be shared at the same time, consider combining them into a well-written summary inside a single banner.</strong>
